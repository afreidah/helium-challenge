# AWS EKS Cluster Challenge

## Overview

Your challenge, if you accept, is to set up an AWS EKS cluster with a secure PostgreSQL client able to read from Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.

In addition to setting up the cluster and Aurora Postgres, you will need to automate this deployment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform. It should be modular, scalable, and easy to extend.

## Submission Requirements

For submission, you will need to provide:

* **Git repository** containing all the source code, scripts, and configuration files
* **Detailed documentation** explaining the setup process, architecture, and optionally monitoring setup
* **Report** (max 1 page) explaining your approach, your other ideas, what went well or not, etc.
